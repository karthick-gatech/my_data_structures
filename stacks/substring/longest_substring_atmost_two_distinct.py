# Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t
# that contains at most 2 distinct characters.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: "eceba"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
#
# Input: "ccaabbb"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

# To solve the problem in one pass let's use here sliding window approach with two set pointers left and
# right serving as the window boundaries.
#
# The idea is to set both pointers in the position 0 and then move right pointer to the right
# while the window contains not more than two distinct characters.
# If at some point we've got 3 distinct characters, let's move left pointer to
# keep not more than 2 distinct characters in the window.
