# Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m,
# you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.
# Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

# Input:
# nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
# m = 2
#
# Output:
# 18
# There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
# The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
# where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
