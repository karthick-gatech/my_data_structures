# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray
# (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

# Let's follow here a solution template for the divide and conquer problems :
#
# Define the base case(s).
# Split the problem into subproblems and solve them recursively.
# Merge the solutions for the subproblems to obtain the solution for the original problem.
